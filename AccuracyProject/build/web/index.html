        <h1>Accuracy Project</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to help hunters/shooters improve their accuracy.<br>
            Users will be able to enter information associated with shooting trips
            including group sizes, pictures, and number of shots fired.<br>
            This information will allow the web site to remind users when their bow strings need replaced,
            and when their gun needs cleaned.<br>
            Users will be able to view graphs of average group sizes over time to find out whether or not they are improving.<br>
            Users will also receive suggestions based on their experience to tell them what ranges they will be able to shoot at certain animals and remain accurate.<br>
            This will involve calculating the size of the animals lungs and their most recent group size at that range.
