=====

The purpose of this project is to help hunters/shooters improve their accuracy.<br>
Users will be able to enter information associated with shooting trips
including group sizes, pictures, and number of shots fired.
This information will allow the web site to remind users when their bow strings need replaced,
and when their gun needs cleaned.
Users will be able to view graphs of average group sizes over time to find out whether or not they are improving.
Users will also receive suggestions based on their experience to tell them what ranges they will be able to shoot at certain animals and remain accurate.
This will involve calculating the size of the animals lungs and their most recent group size at that range.
